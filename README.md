# DAY 1 
## SECTION1 
### INTRODUCTION
In this section, we were introduced to the basics of the Zero to Mastery Machine Learning course and what we will learn throughout the course. We also learned about the different types of machine learning, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, and the differences between regression and classification problems.

Additionally, we discussed the easy and difficult topics in machine learning. Easy topics include linear regression, logistic regression, and decision trees, while difficult topics include deep learning, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.

### Learning Objectives
Understand the basics of the Zero to Mastery Machine Learning course
Learn about the different types of machine learning
Understand the differences between regression and classification problems
Identify easy and difficult topics in machine learning

### Conclusion
In this section, we learned about the basics of the Zero to Mastery Machine Learning course and what we will learn throughout the course. We explored the different types of machine learning and the differences between regression and classification problems. We also identified easy and difficult topics in machine learning.

In the next section, we will dive deeper into the tools and techniques used in machine learning and data science. Stay tuned!

Note: This README file is a brief summary of what we learned in Day 1 Section 1 of the Zero to Mastery Machine Learning course. It is not a comprehensive guide, but rather a starting point for further exploration and learning.

# Exercise: Meet Your Classmates & Instructor

Before we get started, let's do a quick exercise that will take less than 3 minutes:

1. Join our Private Online Classroom: [CLICK HERE TO JOIN NOW](https://community.zerotomastery.io/)

2. Once inside, go to the `#introductions` channel and share who you are, where you are from, and why you chose to do this course.

3. Go to the `#accountability-buddies` and find a buddy who is starting a ZTM course today just like you (doesn't have to be the same course)! You will be keeping each other accountable throughout the course and motivating each other to finish. Who knows, maybe you will find life long friends/coworkers this way.

4. Check out the `#general` or your course specific channel to meet others in your class. We will be announcing class hangouts and instructor meetups/livestreams in there. Some of the channels available for you to join are:

   * `#machinelearning-ai` - For all questions related to Machine Learning, Data Science, and AI
   * `#python` - For all questions python
   * `#alumni` - Ask graduates of this course questions
   * `#womenintech` - For the female coders out there
   * `#job-hunting` - Anything related to finding a job as a developer

   ...and many many more!!

OPTIONAL: A fellow ZTM student, Matt, has made a video walkthrough for you of the community here if you want to watch and take a deep dive as to all the things that happen in the community every month. [Watch the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

# Course updates and cheatsheets?

We are constantly adding new videos and updating this course, announcing new community events, and creating course cheatsheets/resources. To stay up to date with all the latest changes to the course and new videos, keep an eye out on the `#announcements` channel in our Discord community. Anything important will be announced in there (you can scroll to see past announcements).

You can also follow us on twitter where we keep you updated about industry news, upcoming courses, and random thoughts on life:  [@andreineagoie](https://twitter.com/andreineagoie) or [@mrdbourke](https://twitter.com/mrdbourke)

# One more thing...

As you start the course, Udemy will have a popup that  will ask you to leave a review `‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è` of the course. Yes, it can get a little annoying (it's a Udemy system and not something we have control over) but please leave an honest review (even if you just started the course) as it really helps us out and allows more people to discover this course in this massively competitive marketplace. It would truly mean a lot `üòä`.

Thank you and welcome to ZTM!
