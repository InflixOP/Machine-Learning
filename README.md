# Exercise: Meet Your Classmates & Instructor

Before we get started, let's do a quick exercise that will take less than 3 minutes:

1. Join our Private Online Classroom: [CLICK HERE TO JOIN NOW](https://community.zerotomastery.io/)

2. Once inside, go to the `#introductions` channel and share who you are, where you are from, and why you chose to do this course.

3. Go to the `#accountability-buddies` and find a buddy who is starting a ZTM course today just like you (doesn't have to be the same course)! You will be keeping each other accountable throughout the course and motivating each other to finish. Who knows, maybe you will find life long friends/coworkers this way.

4. Check out the `#general` or your course specific channel to meet others in your class. We will be announcing class hangouts and instructor meetups/livestreams in there. Some of the channels available for you to join are:

   * `#machinelearning-ai` - For all questions related to Machine Learning, Data Science, and AI
   * `#python` - For all questions python
   * `#alumni` - Ask graduates of this course questions
   * `#womenintech` - For the female coders out there
   * `#job-hunting` - Anything related to finding a job as a developer

   ...and many many more!!

OPTIONAL: A fellow ZTM student, Matt, has made a video walkthrough for you of the community here if you want to watch and take a deep dive as to all the things that happen in the community every month. [Watch the video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

# Course updates and cheatsheets?

We are constantly adding new videos and updating this course, announcing new community events, and creating course cheatsheets/resources. To stay up to date with all the latest changes to the course and new videos, keep an eye out on the `#announcements` channel in our Discord community. Anything important will be announced in there (you can scroll to see past announcements).

You can also follow us on twitter where we keep you updated about industry news, upcoming courses, and random thoughts on life:  [@andreineagoie](https://twitter.com/andreineagoie) or [@mrdbourke](https://twitter.com/mrdbourke)

# One more thing...

As you start the course, Udemy will have a popup that  will ask you to leave a review `‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è` of the course. Yes, it can get a little annoying (it's a Udemy system and not something we have control over) but please leave an honest review (even if you just started the course) as it really helps us out and allows more people to discover this course in this massively competitive marketplace. It would truly mean a lot `üòä`.

Thank you and welcome to ZTM!

# Asking Questions + Getting Help

Hey there machine learner!

The journey of learning machine learning can be a tough one sometimes. But not to worry, the ZTM community is here to help.

## Questions and answers (Q&A)

If you have a question about any of the code or videos in the course, please feel free to post them in the course Discord (<https://community.zerotomastery.io/>).

Otherwise, you can search/post on the ZTM Machine Learning and Data Science course GitHub Discussions page: <https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/discussions>

You can see an example of how to ask a question here: <https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/discussions/48>

**Questions on GitHub Discussions are far more likely to get answered than questions on Udemy.**

**Why?**

* We believe it‚Äôs better to have all the code + materials + QA in one place. That way updates can be posted if needed.
* Plus, there‚Äôs plenty of people on GitHub who are willing to help out! (if you see a question you think you can answer, feel free to help someone)

## Issues with the course code

If you find any issues with the course code, please post an issue on the course GitHub issues: <https://github.com/mrdbourke/zero-to-mastery-ml/issues>

Happy Machine Learning!

# Monthly Coding Challenges, Free Resources and Guides

Every month in the community, we will have coding challenges for you to participate in, monthly industry blogs and other top free resources emailed to you. We also have annual events like Advent of CodeüéÑ, Hacktoberfest üëæ, and Frosty February Hackathon‚òÉÔ∏è, plus some giveaways üéÅ as well.

Make sure you have your email settings on Udemy to allow this, as every month we will be emailing you a community update email where we list all of the new challenges, free resources, videos and giveaways.

## How to Receive Community Update Emails

Some students have mentioned they do not receive these emails and it's mainly because of their Udemy notification settings. To ensure you receive the community update emails, follow these steps:

1. Go to your Udemy profile icon and click on "Account".
2. Click on "Notification Settings".
3. Make sure you have these two boxes checked:
   - "Monthly updates about courses you're enrolled in"
   - "Announcements about new courses, promotions and exclusive opportunities"

Here's an image to help guide you:

# Overfitting and Underfitting Definitions

Before we get into the experimentation side of things, it's worth having a little reminder of overfitting and underfitting are.

All experiments should be conducted on different portions of your data.

- Training data set: Use this set for model training, 70-80% of your data is the standard.
- Validation/development data set: Use this set for model hyperparameter tuning and experimentation evaluation, 10-15% of your data is the standard.
- Test data set: Use this set for model testing and comparison, 10-15% of your data is the standard.

These amounts can fluctuate slightly, depending on your problem and the data you have.

- Poor performance on training data means the model hasn‚Äôt learned properly and is underfitting. Try a different model, improve the existing one through hyperparameter tuning or collect more data.
- Great performance on the training data but poor performance on test data means your model doesn‚Äôt generalize well. Your model may be overfitting the training data. Try using a simpler model or making sure your the test data is of the same style your model is training on.
- Another form of overfitting can come in the form of better performance on test data than training data. This may mean your testing data is leaking into your training data (incorrect data splits) or you've spent too much time optimizing your model for the test set data. Ensure your training and test datasets are kept separate at all times and avoid optimizing a model's performance on the test set (use the training and validation sets for model improvement).
- Poor performance once deployed (in the real world) means there‚Äôs a difference in what you trained and tested your model on and what is actually happening. Ensure the data you're using during experimentation matches up with the data you're using in production.

# Optional: Elements of AI

Massive effort getting through the first section! There was a lot to go through and if you're thinking, "wow this is too much...", don't worry, you're not alone. Machine learning is broad and learning a new skill takes time.

One place you might want to check out for some auxiliary learning whilst you go through the rest of this course is the [Elements of AI website](https://introduction-to-ai.github.io/).

It's got some great introductory explanations of many of the concepts involved in machine learning, data science and artificial intelligence.

Of course, going through the Elements of AI material is completely optional. But if you need a break from coding (we'll be doing plenty of it), remember it's always there.

Now you've had an introduction to machine learning, let's get your computer set up for it!
